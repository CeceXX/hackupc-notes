# Git workshop
Git is a collaboration tool created by the same guy who made Linux.

## Git init, clone
Use **git init** to start an empty repo with no commits. Git stores code online through a server (can be *GitHub*), and you can push whenever you want.

Computer 1 starts a repo and uploads it on GitHub. Computer 2 and everyone else downloads it and makes change through git clone, git add, git commit, git push.

## Git status, add, push
*git status* tells you about the status of your branch
*git add* adds files to the commit, includes files in a commit
*git push* uploads changes to the server

## Branches
The default branch is *master*. You can create multiple branches and merge them. 

## Resolving conflicts
The big problem is when you push code but somebody else edited the same file in the past. You can fix this by making changes in the code.

## Git ignore
.gitignore, *.py to ignore files.
