Collaboration tool
Created by the same guy who created Linus

**git init** = start an empty repo with no commits

git stores code online so you can store code online. Whenever you are ready push code to the server (can be *GitHub*)

PC1 starts a repo and uploads it on GitHub. Everyone else downloads it and makes change through git clone, git add, git commit, git push.

*git status* tells you about the status of your branch
*git push* uploads changes to the server
