# Git workshop

Collaboration tool. Created by the same guy who made Linux.

## Git init, clone
**git init** = start an empty repo with no commits

git stores code online so you can store code online. Whenever you are ready push code to the server (can be *GitHub*)

PC1 starts a repo and uploads it on GitHub. Everyone else downloads it and makes change through git clone, git add, git commit, git push.

## Git status, add, push
*git status* tells you about the status of your branch
*git add* adds files to the commit
*git push* uploads changes to the server

## Resolving conflicts
The big problem is when you push code but somebody else edited the same file in the past. You can fix this by making changes in the code.
